I decided to develop this when wondering how firefox generated it's "secure passwords".

This project has taught me a lot, including the very basic of front-end, which I don't think will be useless knowledge at all.

I'm willing to keep adding new stuff to this repository as long as my knowledge in web development keeps expanding.
